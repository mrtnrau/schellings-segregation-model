# Bundling [plotly.js](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js) with Webpack

*Note*: Webpack now raises a `Can't resolve 'vertx'` warning, which can *safely be ignored* and suppressed using [Webpack's IgnorePlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/ignore-plugin/) like so: `new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/vertx/)`. The root cause of this warning is that `plotly.js` depends on [`es6-promise`](https://github.com/stefanpenner/es6-promise/blob/master/lib/es6-promise/asap.js), which tries to load `vertx` but gracefully falls back if it isn't present.

## The easy way (recommended)

The easiest way to use `plotly.js` in an app bundled by webpack is just to install it via `npm install plotly.js` and then `require()` or `import` from `'plotly.js/dist/plotly'` instead of from `'plotly.js'`. Doing this will get you a complete version of `plotly.js` (i.e. all chart types) precompiled to browser-friendly ES5 that will work out of the box with pretty much any Webpack configuration.

If you don't want all of `plotly.js` because it's too big (minified it comes in over 2Mb) you can instead load a precompiled [partial bundle](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/dist/README.md#partial-bundles) from `plotly.js/dist/BUNDLENAME`.

## The customization way

**If neither the full bundle nor any of the partial bundles meet your specific needs**, then you should consider putting your own customized bundle together and if you want to use Webpack you'll have to follow the instructions here. The `package.json` file in this repo shows the minimal set of requirements to use the included `webpack.config.js` to bundle plotly.js for either development or production. The resulting `bundle.js` file is based on `index.js` and can be validated by opening `index.html`.

Usage (works with NPM or Yarn):

```bash
npm install
npm run webpack-dev   #takes ~10s for a 5.9MB bundle
npm run webpack-prod  #takes ~60s for a 2.2MB bundle
```

### Explanations

Bundling with webpack requires [ify-loader@1.1.0+](https://github.com/browserify/ify-loader) for the glslify, cwise, and brfs browserify transforms. Additionally, you may wish to use [transform-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/transform-loader) to run plotly.js's custom [compress\_attributes](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/tasks/compress_attributes.js) transform which removes attribute descriptions from the plot schema that aren't needed to create and view plots.

Bundling for production with webpack (i.e. with the `-p` option) by default runs [the UglifyJS plugin](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/uglifyjs-webpack-plugin), which doesn't accept ES6 syntax, so the [babel-loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader) is additionally required, as some of plotly.js' dependencies use this syntax.

## Speeding up the build and reducing the bundle size

The `index.js` file included here loads all of plotly.js but if your application only requires a subset of plot types, you may load a [partial bundle](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.js/blob/master/dist/README.md#partial-bundles) instead for faster build times and reduced bundle sizes.

For example, switching from `require('plotly.js')` to `require('plotly.js/lib/index-basic')` in `index.js` reduces production build times from ~60s to ~15s and bundle size from ~2.2MB to ~690kB.
